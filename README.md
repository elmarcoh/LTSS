Ok, clearly anyone who is here came from the original thread posted on linux-surface. 

FYI: There are no "custom configurations", it is just the same information for installing. Camera and windows hello doesn't work.

The scripts are outdated and are yet to be updated, however I never bothered to do so, so feel free to do so.
